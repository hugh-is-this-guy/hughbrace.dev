review: Hugh is an amazingly talented Engineer. We have worked together across many early stage projects where his speed, ability to take ambiguous and limited direction and to build flexibly and at pace are critical. As a non-technical stakeholder, I’ve always been impressed by how Hugh can convert technical jargon into every day language that enables us to partner easily. 😍
