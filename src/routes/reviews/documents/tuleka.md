review: I reached out to Hugh when Goose needed a website done. I knew that with his years of experience and expertise, that I would get the best value for my investment. The bonus, tho, was his incredible speed, agility, and approachability. With a tiny  team of three – a designer, a content creator, and myself – Hugh coded and set up the current Goose website (with iterations and fixes included) in just 2 weeks! And it was completed, while we were each busy – almost full-time – with other projects; just amazing. We're all very proud of the result!
