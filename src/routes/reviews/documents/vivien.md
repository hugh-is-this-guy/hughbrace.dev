review: Hugh is a an awesome web developer. He took our early stage, ad hoc prototype and rewrote it into an app ready for the real world in a couple of days. His ability to iterate quickly and find creative solutions helped us to build out multiple new features in a short space of time whilst we were finding our product market fit. Weâ€™ve been able to grow up to tens of thousands of users thanks to his work. I will definitely give him a shout when my next web development need arises.
